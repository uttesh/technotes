### What is Machine Learning ?

In simple terms it's a subset of the AI i.e. Artificial Intelligence, Consider there are two images, one is the cat and another one is a dog and we are writing code to identify the object or animal in the file, code became so complex and bulky.
  
Lots of combinational conditions, color identification will be added to provide the desired output i.e. to tell its a cat or dog in the image. if completed the working copy of the code and provide images of black and white of same cat/dog...again we need to change the code, similarly, if we change the images with different angle of the animal again code will fail or we need to re-write the code!!!

To solve the above-mentioned problem with the traditional coding techniques it will be complex or impossible (may not be !!).

Machine Learning is the technique of rules to solve this kind of problem, In ML we build an engine/model and provide thousands of data of images cats/dogs then our model learn the patterns to identify the cat and dog with the provided thousands of images. as it learned different patterns to identify the cat/dog for any given image, it will easily provide the possible accuracy of the match. The more the input data more will be the accuracy.


### Where its used ?

1. Self-driving Cars
2. Robotics
3. Language Processing
4. Stock market trends analysis.
